# HFC-My-Portfolio

AS AN employee
I expect my future employers to look at my portfolio, get to know me a little and see the samples of my work so they can assess whether I am the best fit for what they are in need of.

GIVEN SOMEONE needs to sample my previous work
WHEN YOU load my portfolio
THEN YOU are presented with my name, a recent photo, and links to sections about me, my
work, and how to contact me
WHEN YOU click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN YOU click on the link to the section about my work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the my applications
WHEN YOU are presented with the my first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN YOU click on the images of the applications
THEN YOU are taken to that deployed application
WHEN YOU resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN YOU will presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
